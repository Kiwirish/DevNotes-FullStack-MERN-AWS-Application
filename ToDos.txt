To dos for DevNotes: 

Note app was an initial starting point to turn to DevNotes.
So -> Turn notes into DevNotes

- Need to integrate the rest of the backend API's to the frontend functions and react data saved,

-- Add empty note card for if no cards have been made yet
-- Add Search API so users can search through database for notes
-- Add Pin API so notes that're pinned is noted in db

- Need to transform Notes into DevNotes and perfect apperance attributes
- Need to add toast msg react component
- Need to move React/Vite frontend server to EC2 instance
- Need to move Node/Express backend server to separate EC2 instance
- Need to add images to each note, stored in an AWS S3 Bucket, associated with the note ID
- Test DevNotes on public host and purchase domain name for it, sending the user to the frontend ec2 server host URL

-- potentially add comments to notes that users can leave.. 

DevNotes is a platform where developers can leave notes about their developments to learn
from one another and share projects / creative code.
